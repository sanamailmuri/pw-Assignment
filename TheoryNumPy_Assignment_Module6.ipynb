        "**Answer** NumPy arrays offer significant performance benefits over Python lists, particularly for large-scale numerical operations. These advantages stem from how NumPy arrays are implemented and how they handle memory, computation, and data types. Below is a detailed analysis of the key factors contributing to NumPy's performance superiority:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Contiguous Memory Allocation**\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, meaning that all elements are placed next to each other in memory. This makes access to elements much faster because the CPU can efficiently retrieve consecutive values without following pointers or navigating through complex memory structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, Python lists are stored as arrays of pointers to objects. Each element in a list is a reference to a separate memory location, leading to more memory overhead and slower access times due to the need to dereference these pointers.\n",
        "2. **Homogeneous Data Types**\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays enforce homogeneous data types, meaning that all elements in the array must be of the same type (e.g., all integers, all floats). This uniformity allows NumPy to optimize storage and computation. For example, an array of 32-bit integers can be stored in a block of memory using just 4 bytes per element.\n",

Unlike the numpy.split() function, which requires equal-sized splits, array_split() can handle uneven splits. This flexibility makes array_split() more versatile when the array cannot be divided evenly by the number of requested sub-arrays.\n",
