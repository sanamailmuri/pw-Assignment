Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.**\n\nConstraints in SQL are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity and consistency. They help in avoiding invalid data and maintaining the accuracy of the database. Common types of constraints include:\n\n- **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.\n- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are different.\n- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each record; cannot have NULL or duplicate values.\n- **FOREIGN KEY**: Ensures referential integrity by linking one table to another.\n- **CHECK**: Ensures all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.\n- **DEFAULT**: Assigns a default value if none is provided.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE students (\n    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    age INT CHECK (age >= 5)\n);\n```", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "a502f058", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.**\n\nThe `NOT NULL` constraint is used to ensure that a column cannot contain NULL values. This is important for fields that must always have a value, such as user names or email addresses.\n\nA **Primary Key** cannot contain NULL values because its purpose is to uniquely identify each record in a table. NULL represents an unknown value, which cannot be used for unique identification.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    username TEXT NOT NULL\n);\n```", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "833efee2", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**4.

Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.**\n\nViolating constraints leads to error messages and failure of the SQL operation. This prevents inconsistent or invalid data from being added or modified.\n\nExample:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, age, email)\nVALUES (1, 'John Doe', 16, 'john@example.com');\n```\nThis would violate the `CHECK` constraint for age and produce an error like:\n```\nERROR: new row for relation \"employees\" violates check constraint \"chk_age\"\nDETAIL: Failing row contains (1, John Doe, 16, john@example.com).\n```", "metadata": {}}, {"id": "c34e71a7", "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**6.
