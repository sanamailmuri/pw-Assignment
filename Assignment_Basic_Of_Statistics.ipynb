    "#### Simple Random Sampling:\n",
    "Every individual has an equal chance of being selected. This can be achieved through methods like lottery systems or random number generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stratified Random Sampling:\n",
    "The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on specific characteristics and random samples are drawn from each stratum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Systematic Sampling:\n",
    "Individuals are selected at regular intervals from a randomly ordered list. For example, selecting every 4th sudent from a list of students.\n",

    "Random sampling helps ensure that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the population. By giving each individual an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reduction of Bias:\n",
    "Non-random sampling methods can lead to systematic biases that skew the results. For example, if a survey only includes participants from a specific demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Validity:\n",
    "Many statistical methods and inferential techniques rely on the assumption that the sample is randomly selected. This allows researchers to apply probability theory to make inferences about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizability:\n",
    "When a sample is drawn randomly, the findings can often be generalized to the larger population. This is crucial for policy-making, market research, and scientific studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimation of Sampling Error:\n",

    "Many statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, assume that data are normally distributed. Skewed data can violate these assumptions, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Symmetry:\n",
    "The normal distribution is perfectly symmetric around its mean. This means that the left half of the distribution is a mirror image of the right half.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bell-Shaped Curve:\n",
    "The graph of the normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the highest point at the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean, Median, and Mode:\n",
    "In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal. They are located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defined by Two Parameters:\n",
    "The normal distribution is completely defined by its mean and standard deviation . The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asymptotic:\n",
    "The tails of the normal distribution approach but never quite touch the horizontal axis. This means that there is always a non-zero probability of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Area Under the Curve:\n",
    "The total area under the normal distribution curve is equal to 1, representing the total probability of all possible outcomes."

    "#### 68% of the Data:\n",
    "Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. This means that if we take the mean and add or subtract one standard deviation we will capture about 68% of the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 95% of the Data:\n",
